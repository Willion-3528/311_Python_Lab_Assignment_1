# Python Lab Exercise #1


# Learning Objectives


The purpose of this notebook is for you to review some of the Python covered in the lecture, including the following:

  + Assigning variables
  + Classifying and explaining data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, dictionaries, and tuples)
  + Identifying comparators and boolean operators to create conditional code
  + Making use of lists: indexing, appending, and joining them
  + Making use of dictionaries: identifying, creating, and navigating them
  + Moving between lists and dictionaries (zipping lists together to make dictionaries, or pulling relevant data from a dictionary into a list)
  + Applying for loops to lists and dictionaries


Some new things we're bringing up that weren't covered in class:

  + Using f-strings or .format() to print readable code with variables
  + Using .zip() to combine two lists into a dictionary
